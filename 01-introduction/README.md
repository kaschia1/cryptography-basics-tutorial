# Introduction to Cryptography

Cryptography is the art of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format unless you have the key to decipher it. It has been used for centuries to protect sensitive data.

In this tutorial, we will explore the basics of cryptography, including the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing, and digital signatures.

### Key Concepts

- **Encryption**: The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext.
- **Decryption**: The process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext.
- **Key**: A piece of information used in the encryption and decryption process.
